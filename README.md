## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Having to figure out where the buttons and specficually the versioncontroller.swift is located
-  Having to restart the project entirely and (currently) figuring out the "Repository, Push and Commit" video.
-  Ideas to improve the feature:
  - Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
    - Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
    - Implement a way to change the color of the text as well
